# jekyll-bootstrap4

An up-to-date Bootstrap ready Jekyll theme. I wanted a Jekyll Bootstrap website
but I was having too much fun developing the core, rather than the website, so
I split the two projects.

## Acknowledgments:

* Minima theme - Base theme. You'll find code traces here and there
* Minimal Mistakes theme - Lots of ideas stolen from that
